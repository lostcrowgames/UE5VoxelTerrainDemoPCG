# UE5VoxelTerrainDemoPCG

This is a fork of bw2012's UE5VoxelTerrainDemo.

Currently using Unreal Engine 5.7.1.

# GOAL: 
The goal is to create a powerful multiplayer-ready procedural world generator similar to Valheim, using bw2012's voxel terrain generator as a base, and extending it to use PCG to generate forests, biomes, villages camps, etc...

Unreal Engine 5 procedural voxel terrian example (partially based on [Transvoxel™](https://github.com/EricLengyel/Transvoxel) Algorithm by Eric Lengyel)
This project provides tools to generate, visualize and in-game change volume terrain using voxels.

> [!NOTE]  
> Tested with Unreal Engine 5.7.1. Not backwards compatible with older versions of Unreal Engine 5.
